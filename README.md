# Chip Ahoyto 🍪

CHIP-8 emulator written in rust 🦀.

The goal of this project is purely experimental and a learning tool for rust.

## Goals

* Performance 🏎
* Separation of concerns - presentation vs logic 
* Simplicity 😀
* Compatibility 🪛

## Features

* Drag and drop support for ROMs
* Pallet switching
* Visual diagnostics
* Variable CPU frequency
* RAM snapshot saving and loading - (TODO)
