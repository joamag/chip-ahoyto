# CHIP-Ahoyto üç™

CHIP-8 emulator written in Rust ü¶Ä.

The goal of this project is purely experimental and a learning tool for rust.

The work of this emulator was inspired/started by [jc-chip8](https://github.com/joao-conde/jc-chip8).

You can check a working version of the emulator at **[chip-ahoyto.joao.me](https://chip-ahoyto.joao.me)**

## Goals

* Performance üèé
* Separation of concerns üññ
* Simplicity üòÄ
* Compatibility ü™õ

## Features

* Drag and drop support for ROMs
* Pallet switching
* Visual diagnostics
* Variable CPU frequency
* Multiple engine implementations (classic and neo)
* Full compliant with test CHIP-8 ROMs
* RAM snapshot saving and loading
* [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) support üåê

## Build

### WASM for Node.js

```bash
cargo install wasm-pack
wasm-pack build --release --target=nodejs -- --features wasm
```

### WASM for Web

```bash
cargo install wasm-pack
wasm-pack build --release --target=web --out-dir=examples/web/lib -- --features wasm
cd examples/web
npm install && npm run build
cd dist && python3 -m http.server
```

## Reason

And... yes this is the real inspiration behind the emulator's name:
