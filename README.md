# CHIP-Ahoyto 🍪

CHIP-8 emulator written in rust 🦀.

The goal of this project is purely experimental and a learning tool for rust.

The work of this emulator was inspired/started by [jc-chip8](https://github.com/joao-conde/jc-chip8).

## Goals

* Performance 🏎
* Separation of concerns 🖖
* Simplicity 😀
* Compatibility 🪛

## Features

* Drag and drop support for ROMs
* Pallet switching
* Visual diagnostics
* Variable CPU frequency
* Multiple engine implementations (classic and neo)
* Full compliant with test CHIP-8 ROMs
* RAM snapshot saving and loading

## Reason

And... yes this is the real inspiration behind the emulator's name:
